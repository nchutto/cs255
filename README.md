# CS-255: DriverPass Portfolio Submission

##  Project Overview
The DriverPass project was developed to assist a client from Engage Learning Group in offering an integrated online and on-the-road training program for driving students. The system was designed to streamline registration, lesson scheduling, practice exams, and progress tracking. It also supports role-specific functionality for instructors, administrators, and secretaries.

## What I Did Well
- Clearly outlined business and technical requirements
- Designed functional UML diagrams to represent system workflows
- Prioritized user roles and their access needs for secure and efficient functionality
- Focused on security, responsiveness, and cloud-based reliability in the system architecture

## What I Would Improve
I would enhance the formatting of the UML diagrams to make them more visually engaging and easier to interpret. Additionally, Iâ€™d seek earlier user feedback to validate design choices before finalizing documentation.

## Understanding and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted user needs from interview transcripts and turned them into actionable requirements. Emphasizing user needs helps align system functionality with real-world expectations, ensuring the solution is user-centered and effective.

## My Approach to Software Design
I start by identifying user roles, needs, and technical constraints. Then, I use visual modeling (UML), functional breakdowns, and documentation to guide development. Going forward, I aim to use agile modeling, prototyping, and continuous user validation for better iteration.
